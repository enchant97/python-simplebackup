# Simple Backup
A Python3 app designed to be simple to use and efficient.

## Notes
- This app has no **required** dependencies for it to function fully other than python3 and will stay that way.
- The app configuration file will be created in the simplebackup folder on first run
- Config is shared with both CLI and GUI version

## How To Run
- You can either run from the directory you downloaded it to or install it as a python package using the `setup.py` file
- For CLI version run `python3 -m simplebackup`
- For GUI version run
  - `python3 -m simplebackup gui`
  - or run the `simple-backup.pyw` file
  - download the exe file for Windows 64bit systems

## TODO
- Restore function
- Rewrite CLI code for how the user would issue commands
