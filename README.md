# Simple Backup
A Python3 app designed to be simple to use and efficient.

## Notes
- This app has no **required** dependencies for it to function fully other than python3 and will stay that way.
- The app configuration file will be created in the simplebackup folder on first run
- Config is shared with both CLI and GUI version

## How To Run
- You can either run from the directory you downloaded it to or install it as a python package using the `setup.py` file
- For CLI version run `python3 -m simplebackup`
- For GUI version run `python3 -m simplebackup gui`

## TODO
- Better format for showing all of the included folders to backup in the GUI
- Ability to skip backing up certain folders
- Add doc-strings to all functions/classes
- Show last backup date
- Optional tar compression option
- Restore function
