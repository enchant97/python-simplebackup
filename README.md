# Simple Backup
A Python3 app designed to be simple to use and efficient.

> **This app is no longer in active development** by me, use the new app written in dotnet [here](https://github.com/enchant97/simple-backup)

## Notes
- This app has no **required** dependencies for it to function fully other than python3 and will stay that way.
- The app configuration file will be created at `$HOME/.config/simple-backup/config.json`
- Config is shared with both CLI and GUI version

## How To Run
- You can either run from the directory you downloaded it to or install it as a python package using the `setup.py` file
- For CLI version run `python3 -m simplebackup --cli`
- For GUI version run
  - `python3 -m simplebackup`
  - or run the `simple-backup.pyw` file

## TODO
- Restore function
- Rewrite CLI code for how the user would issue commands
